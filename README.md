pokespeed.js
=========

Pokemon speed EV calculator.

This is the brains behind choicescarf.com. I was sick of trying to work out EV spreads to specifically outspeed other spreads, so I made this to do it for me. As I found it useful I wanted to share it. I decided to build a simple site for it that other people could use too.

It is simple javascript which essentially does algebra. It is constructed of while loops and if statements.

If you can make it better, please do. I'm only new to js and code in general
